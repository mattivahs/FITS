# Forward Invariance in Trajectory Spaces (FITS)
This repository contains the code of the paper *Forward Invariance in Trajectory Spaces for Safety-critical Control*.
We use two simulation environments, a custom navigation in a cluttered environment and the Quadcopter 2D environment in [safe-control-gym]([https://gym.openai.com](https://github.com/utiasDSL/safe-control-gym))safe-control-gym (<a href="[https://www.example.com/my great page](https://github.com/utiasDSL/safe-control-gym)">link</a>).
